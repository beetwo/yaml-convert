            # Hate Crime

            In order for the collected data to be comparable, this platform uses the OSCE/ODIHR’s definition of hate crime. At the [OSCE Ministerial Council in Athens](http://www.osce.org/node/63629) in 2009, OSCE participating States acknowledged that »hate crimes are criminal offences committed with a bias motive.« Simply put, hate crime must constitute an offence under criminal law and be motivated by bias.

            # There are three broad types of criminal offences:

            - Physical violence
            - Threats
            - Damage to property

            # There are several types of bias motivation:

            - Racism and xenophobia
            - Bias against Roma and Sinti
            - Anti-Semitism
            - Bias against Muslims
            - Bias against Christians and members of other religions

    Purpose:
        title: Purpose
        header: ''
        text: |
            The purpose of this reporting platform is threefold.

            **Firstly,** the platform is designed to support local NGOs in collecting data on hate crime, hate speech and discrimination. Local NGOs use this data for the purpose of advocacy within their respective countries. For example, NGOs will raise the awareness of respective governments of the problems in their countries and lobby for better legislation to counter the phenomena of hate crime, hate speech and discrimination.

            **Secondly,** the platform is designed to help local NGOs provide victim support and to manage hate crime, hate speech and discriminatory incidents. Victims are given the voluntary option to report the specific incident to local police. Local NGOs will support victims throughout this process.

            **Thirdly,** the platform will enable local NGOs to export the hate crime data to the Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights (ODIHR) of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE). Please note that only the data on hate crime and not the data on hate speech and discrimination will be reported to ODIHR. ODIHR publishes hate crime data on hatecrime.osce.org annually.
            Thus, by filling in the designated reporting form you are helping to create a better overview of the situation regarding hate crime within your country, and you will be given assistance by local NGOs to follow-up on the specific hate crime, hate speech or discrimination committed against you (note that this is optional).
